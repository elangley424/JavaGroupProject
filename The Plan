/* Your application should use all four of the collections data types we covered: 
â€¢ Arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, HashSets



// Get available room list 
// welcome the user, ask how many beds, show available rooms

//rooms will be its own class file (roomInfo.java) (can use has-a relationship) 
//generate room number, like 103 305 506

// (Example) Two Bed rooms: 
// 1st floor: 10 rooms are available 
// 2nd floor: 10 rooms are available 
// 3rd floor: 10 rooms are available 
// 4th floor: 10 rooms are available 
// 5th floor: 10 rooms are available

// create conditional for rooms if they pick a category that has no rooms available: 
// print out a statement that says there isnt any available 
// just like the inclass library example

//select ammenities from ammenities.java 
// extra towels, breakfast, pool access, minibar

//inform user of the price(seperate class priceInfo.java 
//(different price for each floor, and different beds)

//get user info, get payment info 
//name, billing address, creditcard info, ID

// confirm room reservation, print recipt 
// conditional makes the room unavailable (through a loop)
